    I started my career with zero knowledge about semiconductor but 3 years in Infineon accorded me with broad knowledge especially regarding automation fab technologies.
    I successfully integrated more than 40 machines into the system and became subject matter experts for Implanter and Preassembly process integration. I was also the team lead for final system verification during major shutdown.
