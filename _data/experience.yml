    I started my career with zero knowledge about semiconductor but 3 years in Infineon accorded me with broad knowledge especially regarding automation fab technologies.
    I successfully integrated more than 40 machines into the system and became subject matter experts for Implanter and Preassembly process integration. I was also the team lead for final system verification during major shutdown.
    Whilst at Infineon I had the opportunity to work with : <mark>SECS/GEM</mark>, <mark>MES</mark>,<mark>OpenSIM Pro</mark>
